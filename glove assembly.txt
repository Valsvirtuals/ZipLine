===============
PART 1: Fingers
---------------
1- slide the zip ties on every "zip tips",the head of the zip tie should face down and snap in place,
   once secured it will then stick out inside of the "zip tip", cut the exece of th"e head where it would interfeer with your finger.

2- put on the glove and hot glue the "zip tip" to the end of one of the gloves finger.
   after apllying the hot glue, wait to let the glue cool down a bit so that you don't burn yourself.

3- slide on the first "zip guide", apply hot glue, close your fist for better alignement and then stick the "zip guide" well centred on the next knuckle,
   do the same for the next "zip guide" (exept for the thumb). Repeat step 2&3 for each finger.

==============================
PART 2: Finger Tracking Module
------------------------------
4- "dovetail slide" sloud be able to slide freely in "dovetail way", if it is not make sure there is no defect on the sliding surfaces,
   then sand the top of "dovetail way" with 180 grit(or higher) sand paper, a bit of graphite frome a pencil can help .

5- super glue a small section of gt2 belt (3x35mm) onto the long side of the top of "dovetail slide"

6- bolt the potetiometers onto "FTM frame", press "z24 gear" onto the shaft of the potentiometer, as shone in "description finger tracking module.png".
   depending on your finger spacing, you might need to cut of the excess leght of the shaft on 3 potentiometer,
   use a hacksaw and cut slowly as to not make any heat buildup.(it is also advised to lubricate your potentiometers before step 5)

7- with the glove on, position "dovetail way"(with dovetail slide on it) on the back of the hand aligned to a finger.
   the zip tie sould fit in the dovetail, in the track at the bottom of "dovetail slide".
   close your fist, aligne the front of "dovetail slide" to the front of "dovetail way",
   mark the zip tie at the back of "dovetail slide" (paint pen work well) and cut the zip tie to lengh.

8- slide "FTM frame" onto the zip tie, make sure it is in the right orientation.
   glue the end of the zip tie to "dovetail slide" with super glue , make sure it is in the right orientation.
   wipe excess glue and wait for it to fully set.

9-slide "dovetail way" onto "dovetail slide" and in position in "FTM frame".make sure the rack and pinion mesh properly and with a few drops
  of super glue from the bottom, glue "dovetail way" onto "FTM frame" make sure to NOT glue "dovetail slide" for obvious reasons.

10-with the glove on, fist closed, "dovetail slide" all the way forward, hot glue the finger tracking module inline with the finger it's attached to,
   making sure there is enough space left for "back hand farme" Repeat step 7 to 10 for each finger.

================
Part 3: the rest
----------------
11-hot glue "back hand frame" to the back of the hand, slide the esp32 in place and secure it with a small blob of hot glue on two opposing corner,
   snap on the controller mount

12-wiring, should be the same as LucidVR prototype3, this is also when you can add your own joystick and buttons.

13-lubrication, put a drop of light machine oil o the "dovetail way", "z24 gear" and "zip guide" and move things for a bit

14-sideload the firmware onto the esp32 and enjoy your glove :)
